# Changelog

All notable changes to RAF are recorded here. The workspace ships one version
across all crates. Until 1.0.0 a breaking change bumps the minor version.

## [Unreleased]

- **Workspace scaffold:** a Cargo workspace on edition 2024 with a floating
  nightly development toolchain and a minimum supported Rust version of 1.98.1,
  shared workspace lints (missing documentation, unreachable `pub` and unsafe
  code denied, clippy pedantic), formatting and clippy settings, and a
  supply-chain policy for `cargo deny`.
- **Licensing:** first-party code is offered under `MIT OR Apache-2.0 OR
  MulanPSL-2.0` and every Markdown document under CC-BY-4.0, with the licence
  texts, a Chinese-language rendering of the licensing terms, and REUSE
  metadata checked by `reuse lint`.
- **Gates:** `make check` runs formatting, clippy, tests, documentation,
  `cargo deny`, REUSE, the minimum-version build, the licence digests and the
  issue-reference gate. A pre-commit hook runs the fast subset on the staged
  index, and a CI workflow runs the same gates.
- **Project documents:** an agent guide, contributing guide, code of conduct,
  security policy, issue and pull request templates, citation metadata and a
  release-notes configuration driven by conventional commits.
